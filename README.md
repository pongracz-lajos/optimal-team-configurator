# optimal-team-configurator
Given a set of N people and a list of pairs describing which persons can collaborate with each other, using evolutionary computation find a configuration of teams of max M people (M &lt; N / 2) where the collaboration coefficient of each team is maximum. The collaboration coefficient is a number describing how much the members of a team can collaborate with each other, for example the coefficient is higher if two members can collaborate with each other (the pair is in the list).
