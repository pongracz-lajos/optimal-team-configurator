# Optimal (effective) team configurator

Given a set of N people and a list of pairs describing which persons sympathize with each other, using evolutionary computation find a configuration of teams of max M people (M < N / 2) where the collaboration coefficient of each team is maximum. The collaboration coefficient is a number describing how much the members of a team can collaborate with each other, for example the coefficient is higher if two members sympathize with each other (the pair is in the list).
